This is a sample file, demonstrating the use of `timer.js`, a bit of javascript that provides a countdown timer for timed assignments on Carnap.io:

<https://github.com/dsanson/carnap-javascript>.

To use `timer.js` in your own assignments, include a link to the script in the YAML header:

```
---
js: https://dsanson.github.io/carnap-javascript/js/checklist.js
---
```

And include an empty span or div in your document with the identifier `#testTimer`:

```markdown
Time remaining: <span id="testTimer"></span>
```

Note that the timer will function only when your document is an actual assignment on Carnap, with a time limit. So if you want to see this example in action, you need to upload it, then assign it, with a time limit, to a course. At which point, this countdown timer should be live:

Time remaining: <span id="testTimer"></span>

The script tries to be smart about how much detail to display. Days left are displayed when there is more than a day remaining. Hours left, if there is more than an hour remaining. Minutes remaining are displayed when less than 3 hours are remaining. Seconds are displayed when there are less than 2 minutes remaining.

These feel like features that should be configurable. For the moment, it is easy enough to make changes by editing the script:

```javascript
if (remaining > day) {
    d = Math.floor(remaining/day)
    display = display + d + 'd ';
}
if (remaining > hour) {
    display = display + r.getUTCHours() + 'h ';
}
if (3 * hour > remaining > minute) {
    display = display + r.getUTCMinutes() + 'm ';
}
if (remaining < 2 * minute) {
    display = display + r.getUTCSeconds() + 's ';
}
if (remaining < 0) {
    display = "0s";
    clearInterval(myVar);
}
```
