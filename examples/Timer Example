# Timer

Time Remaining: <span id="testTimer">SCRIPT NOT LOADED</span>

Raw markdown:

    Time Remaining: <span id="testTimer">SCRIPT NOT LOADED</span>

# About

This is a sample file, demonstrating the use of `timer.js`, a bit of
javascript that provides a countdown timer for timed assignments on Carnap.io.
For the source, see:

<https://github.com/dsanson/carnap-javascript>.

You can view this as a "live" document here:

<https://carnap.io/shared/dsanson@gmail.com/Timer%20Example>

If you are viewing this as as the live sample document in demo mode, you will
see, after "Time Remaining" at the top of this page, a 5 minute countdown.
When the time drops below 2 minutes, the timer will show both minutes and
seconds.

To use this for real, upload a document to Carnap containing a link to the
script in its YAML header:

    ---
    js: https://dsanson.github.io/carnap-javascript/js/timer.js?v=4
    ---

Include in the document a `span` or `div` with the id 'testTimer':

    Time Remaining: <span id="testTimer">SCRIPT NOT LOADED</span>

You can verify that the script is working by viewing your uploaded document,
which should show you the demo 5 minute timer. You can then assign the
document, and set a time limit. Verify that the script is working by opening
the assignment. It should show you a timer counting down the time left for the
assignment.

# How Much Detail to Display

If an assignment has two days left, I don't think the students want to see the
seconds ticking away. For now, the timer is hard-coded to display different
levels of detail depending on how much time is left:

-   Days left are displayed when there is more than a day remaining.
-   Hours left are displayed if there is more than an hour remaining.
-   Minutes left are displayed when there is less than a day but more than a
    minute remaining.
-   Seconds left displayed when there are less than 5 minutes remaining.

These feel like features that should be configurable. But for the moment they
are hardwired, so can only be configured by editing the script.

# Custom CSS

You will probably want to adjust the appearance of your timer using custom
CSS. You can use custom CSS by linking to it in your YAML header:

    ---
    js: https://dsanson.github.io/carnap-javascript/js/timer.js
    css: https://url-to-your-css
    ---

If you want the timer in the top right corner of your window, you can use the
CSS in my github repo:

    js: https://dsanson.github.io/carnap-javascript/js/timer.js
    css: https://dsanson.github.io/carnap-javascript/css/timer.css
    ---

# Automatic Creation of `<div id="testTimer>`

If you load the script on a page with no element with the id 'testTimer', the script will insert
an appropriate `div` at the beginning of the `article` element. This works
well when you plan to use custom CSS to position the timer.

You can see a live demo here:
