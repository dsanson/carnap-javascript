This is a sample file, demonstrating the use of `timer.js`, a bit of javascript that provides a countdown timer for timed assignments on Carnap.io. For the source, see:

<https://github.com/dsanson/carnap-javascript>. 

For a "live" sample document, see:

<https://carnap.io/shared/dsanson@gmail.com/Timer%20Example>

If you are viewing this as as the live sample document, you should see live timer here:

Time remaining: **<span id="testTimer"></span>**.

But what you are seeing is the timer in "demo" mode, which is hard coded to count down for 5 minutes. To see a real countdown timer, add upload a document that with a link to the script in the YAML header:

```
---
js: https://dsanson.github.io/carnap-javascript/js/checklist.js
---
```

And, somewhere in the document, a `span` or `div` with the id `testTimer`:


```markdown
Time remaining: **<span id="testTimer"></span>**.
```

Then assign that uploaded document, and set a time limit on the assignment. The countdown timer should then correctly show the time remaining to complete that assignment.

The script tries to be smart about how much detail to display. Days left are displayed when there is more than a day remaining. Hours left, if there is more than an hour remaining. Minutes remaining are displayed when less than 3 hours are remaining. Seconds are displayed when there are less than 2 minutes remaining.

These feel like features that should be configurable. For the moment, it is easy enough to make changes by editing the script:

```javascript
if (remaining > day) {
    d = Math.floor(remaining/day)
    display = display + d + 'd ';
}
if (remaining > hour) {
    display = display + r.getUTCHours() + 'h ';
}
if (3 * hour > remaining > minute) {
    display = display + r.getUTCMinutes() + 'm ';
}
if (remaining < 2 * minute) {
    display = display + r.getUTCSeconds() + 's ';
}
if (remaining < 0) {
    display = "0s";
    clearInterval(myVar);
}
```
