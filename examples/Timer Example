<div id="#testTimer"></div>

This is a sample file, demonstrating the use of `timer.js`, a bit of javascript that provides a countdown timer for timed assignments on Carnap.io. For the source, see:

<https://github.com/dsanson/carnap-javascript>. 

For a "live" sample document, see:

<https://carnap.io/shared/dsanson@gmail.com/Timer%20Example>

If you are viewing this as as the live sample document, you should see the
live timer in the bottom right corner of the page. What you are seeing is not
an actual countdown to when the assignment is due, because you aren't viewing
an actual timed assignment. You are seeing the timer in demo mode, hard-coded
to count down for 5 minutes.

To see a real countdown timer, add upload a document with a link to the script
and the CSS file in the YAML header:

```
---
js: https://dsanson.github.io/carnap-javascript/js/checklist.js
css: https://dsanson.github.io/carnap-javascript/css/timer.css
---
```

Then assign that uploaded document, and set a time limit on the assignment. The countdown timer should then correctly show the time remaining to complete that assignment.

The script tries to be smart about how much detail to display. Days left are displayed when there is more than a day remaining. Hours left, if there is more than an hour remaining. Minutes remaining are displayed when less than 3 hours are remaining. Seconds are displayed when there are less than 2 minutes remaining.

These feel like features that should be configurable. But for the moment they are hardwired (though it would be easy to tweak them by editing the script).
