# carnap-javascript

This is a place for me to put javascript snippets and widgets that are meant to work
with <https://carnap.io>.

# checklist.js

This can be used to add persistent checklists to Carnap assignment pages. To
try it out, upload the `Checklist Example` file in [examples](examples) to Carnap.io,
and make it into an assignment. It is also available as a shared document on
Carnap.io:

<https://carnap.io/shared/dsanson@gmail.com/Checklist%20Example>

But note that the script only works when the document is made into an
*assignment*, so to test it out, you will need to download the shared file from Carnap, and then upload it, and then assign it.
